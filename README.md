# Climate Data

This program uses Java to clean a dataset of daily average temperature readings. In order for the program to run sucessfully you must extract the raw_data.zip. Make sure the extracted raw_data directory has no subdirectories and contains just the data (.csv) files.

The "city_temperature.csv" data was obtained from University of Dayton via Kaggle.

The program also aggregates the University of Dayton data with additional data from NOAA sourced from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/.
Additional data can be added to the raw_data folder to expand the data set.

This cleaned data set was then used for my Projected Global Temperatures Tableau project which can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abraham.aslanides/viz/ProjectedGlobalTemperaturesDashboard_17027094823090/GlobalTemperatureChange
