This program uses Java to clean a dataset of daily average temperature readings. In order for the program to run sucessfully you must extract "city_temperature.csv" contained within the "raw_data" directory. 

The "city_temperature.csv" data was obtained from University of Dayton via Kaggle.

The program can also aggregate the University of Dayton data with additional data from NOAA by using https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/.
Extract additional datasets in the "raw_data" directory and run the program to see it in action.
