This program uses Java to clean a dataset of daily average temperature readings. In order for the program to run sucessfully you must extract the raw_data.zip. Make sure the extracted raw_data directory has no subdirectories and contains just the data (.csv) files.

The "city_temperature.csv" data was obtained from University of Dayton via Kaggle.

The program also aggregates the University of Dayton data with additional data from NOAA sourced from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/.
Extract additional datasets in the "raw_data" directory and run the program to see it in action.
